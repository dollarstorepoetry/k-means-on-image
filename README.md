k-means. yay

Someone has definitely done this in a much more optimized fashion, but I'm bored, and that's always a good enough reason to make a little script.

### files
`kmeansonimage.py` - run the k-means algorithm on an image to find the *k* most prominent colors. run this program in the terminal with the format `python kmeansonimage.py [image path] [k]`.

`kmeansonpersonality.py` - this also runs the k-means algorithm, but this time it's to cluster people based on their big five personality results. this uses `.csv` data obtained from [an open source Big Five personality test](https://bigfive-test.com). this is definitely just a pet project of mine, though.
